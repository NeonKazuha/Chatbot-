Chatbot Project
Description
This project is a simple chatbot trained using a dataset from niraliivaghani/chatbot-dataset on Kaggle. The chatbot is built using TensorFlow's Tokenizer and embedding layers along with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network. The chatbot can respond to various queries based on the training data provided.

Features
Conversational AI: The chatbot can engage in simple conversations based on the training data.
Natural Language Processing: Utilizes TensorFlow's Tokenizer, embedding layers, and GRU for handling sequence data and generating responses.
Easy to Use: Simple interface for interacting with the chatbot.
Dataset
The dataset used for training the chatbot is sourced from Kaggle. It contains various question-answer pairs that the chatbot uses to learn and generate responses.

Model
The chatbot is trained using a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) neural network with TensorFlow's Tokenizer and embedding layers. GRUs are effective for handling sequential data and are less computationally intensive compared to other RNN variants like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory).
